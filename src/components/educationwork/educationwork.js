                <h4>Animation</h4>
                Animation is all about creating characters and bringing them to life. 
                By learning the principles of animation, students also explore the 
                mechanics of how we move, talk, and act in different situations. After 
                passing three levels of the animation workshop, students have a strong 
                enough base to continue animating and improving their skills independently.
                They can put all of this knowledge to use in 3D animation, stop motion
                animation and more. <a href="https://tumo.org/project/animation/" target="_blank">For more info</a>

                <h4>Game development</h4>
                Playing games is easy, building a game is a wholly different experience. 
                The entire point of the TUMO game development workshops is to create a 
                new gaming universe from design to programming and everything in between. 
                By the end of the three levels, each participant will be able to design 
                and develop their own 3D video game using the Unity Engine. What they learn 
                can be applied to most industry-leading game engines.<a href="https://tumo.org/project/gamedev/" target="_blank">For more info</a>

                <h4>Web Development</h4>
                By learning HTML & CSS to PHP & MySQL and, finally, CMS, students acquire 
                fundamental industry skills. However the primary goal is not to teach students 
                how to follow instructions but present students with the tools to facilitate 
                problem-solving so that they can achieve independence and think beyond the 
                browser window. <a href="https://tumo.org/project/webdevelopment/" target="_blank">For more info</a>

                    <h4>Filmmaking</h4>
                    Whether students are interested in creating fictional or documentary, 
                    art-house or blockbuster, short or feature-length, this workshop is where 
                    to get started. By the end of the third level, students conceive, produce, 
                    film and edit their own short film. Filmmaking workshops give students 
                    insight and hands-on experience with the foundations of filmmaking: planning, 
                    shooting, and editing. In short, telling a visual story. <a href="https://tumo.org/project/filmmaking/" target="_blank">For more info</a>

                    <h4>Graphic Design</h4>
                    Graphic Design shows students how the world communicates visually, how they can
                     widen their scopes of creativity and all that awaits them within the creative 
                     market. Students begin by exploring the fundamentals of design and then move 
                     forward by creating designs and branding using industry-standard tools such as 
                     Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. <a href="https://tumo.org/project/graphicdesign/" target="_blank">For more info</a>

                    recourcing and finding right career opportunities in Armenia. It was vitally
